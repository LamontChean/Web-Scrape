# Web Scraping with Parallelism

## Core Functionality

This project demonstrates **parallel web scraping** where the goal is to scrape multiple web pages concurrently from the website [quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com/). This method is particularly useful when scraping large datasets from websites that require significant wait times due to network latency.

### Core Features:

1. **Web Scraping**: The program fetches HTML data from multiple pages on the website and extracts quotes and authors.
2. **Parallelism**: Using Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`, multiple pages are scraped simultaneously, significantly speeding up the process compared to sequential scraping.
3. **Data Extraction**: The quotes and authors are extracted using `BeautifulSoup`, a Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
4. **Data Storage**: The scraped quotes and authors are saved in a text file (`data.txt`), which can later be used for further analysis or data processing.

### Process Flow:

1. **Sending Requests**: The script sends HTTP GET requests to the target website using the `requests` library.
2. **Parsing HTML**: Once the HTML response is received, the content is parsed using `BeautifulSoup` to extract the required data: quotes and author names.
3. **Concurrency**: With `ThreadPoolExecutor`, multiple requests are sent in parallel to scrape data from different pages. This ensures that the program doesn't need to wait for one page to finish scraping before starting on the next.
4. **Storing Data**: After extracting the quotes and authors, the data is written into a file (`data.txt`), formatted as: `quote text; author name`.

### Example:

For instance, the following quote from Albert Einstein is scraped from the site:

```
"The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking." ; Albert Einstein
```

Each page is processed in parallel, allowing the program to scrape multiple pages in less time.

## Code Breakdown:

* **`scrape(page)`**: This function performs the scraping of a single page. It receives a page number (`page`) as an argument and makes a request to the corresponding URL. The HTML is parsed to extract the quotes and authors, which are written to the file `data.txt`.

* **`ThreadPoolExecutor`**: The script uses the `ThreadPoolExecutor` to create a pool of worker threads, each of which scrapes a specific page. This reduces the time required to scrape the data from multiple pages.

* **File Handling**: Data is written to `data.txt` using the `writelines()` function. Each quote and author pair is written in the format: `quote text; author name`.

## Benefits of Parallelism in Web Scraping

The primary advantage of using parallelism in this project is the **reduced scraping time**. Without parallelism, the program would need to scrape one page at a time, waiting for each request to finish before starting the next. With parallelism, multiple pages are scraped concurrently, significantly speeding up the process.
